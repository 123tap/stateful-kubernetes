# Stateful Apps and Tooling for Kubernetes

_This is a list of resources for all thingz stateful apps and tooling in and for Kubernetes. I'll do an initial dump of my bookmarks here but would really appreciate it if you heavily [PR it](https://github.com/mhausenblas/stateful-kubernetes/pulls), or if you don't feel comfortable doing this, at least raise an [issue](https://github.com/mhausenblas/stateful-kubernetes/issues) for what's missing. If you send in suggestions or update the resources directly, please also add yourself to the [list of contributors](CONTRIBUTORS) using a website, a mail address or a Twitter handle to sign off._
